# Junction 2023 - Diary Assistant

http://34.36.203.42/

Diary is a common tool for dealing with different kinds of issues including chronic pain (in some cases writing a diary can even be prescribed).
It's a safe place where you pour down your feelings, express your ideas, your hopes, your sadness. It’s hard to stick to a diary routine though - it’s often unmotivating and can feel lonely.

What if where would be someone ready to help?

We developed a friendly assistant which
- could watch you write your diary
- gives quirky comments about your writing every now and then if everything is fine
- detects potential issues and suggests on how to deal with them
- proposes call to help if the situation looks critical

We tried to convey the idea by implementing it as a web application. With the help of LLM we can detect and rank issues given diary notes, provide links to the specialized resource* along with summarization.

The app is available for you to try. Check it out!

*for the demo purposes we choose HowTo wiki as a resource, but in real world it could be manually crafted sources with the help of medical professionals.
